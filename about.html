            <h2>Meet Nguyen Van Tri</h2>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m a Vietnamese game developer with a passion for every kind of game â€” regardless of genre, platform, or complexity. 
                I love experimenting with ideas, crafting gameplay mechanics, and constantly pushing myself to think outside the box. 
                I'm always exploring, researching, and iterating â€” all to deliver meaningful experiences down to the smallest detail.
            </p>

                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    Graduated from a U.S.-based Computer Science program taught entirely in English (Troy University â€“ HUST). 
                    Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of game and software projects â€” from solo indie games to university group work â€” 
                    and each project has been a new opportunity to explore, learn, and grow.
                </p>

                <h3>My Skillset</h3>
                <p>
                    I specialize in Unity (C#), with experience in gameplay programming, UI/UX design, animation systems, and performance optimization.
                    Beyond game development, I also work with JavaFX, Spring Boot, and Git â€” bringing full-stack experience to the table.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>My Values</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe great games come from curiosity, care, and iteration. I aim to design gameplay that feels intuitive, 
                    polish each detail with intention, and create something that players can truly connect with. 
                    Innovation and creativity are at the core of everything I build.
